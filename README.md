## Objective
To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location. It is optimized for both Android and iOS devices. Expo was used to develop the app and Google Firestore to store the chat messages and images/map views.
## User Stories
- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.
## Key Features
- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- Provide users with two additional communication features: sending images (either from device library or device camera) and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline, allowing users to access the chat and previous messages even when they are offline.

## Installation
- Clone this repository
- Install Node.js. _To avoid any potential conflicts, it is recommended to use version 16.19.0._
  ```
  nvm install 16.19.0
  nvm use 16.19.0
  nvm alias default 16.19.0
  ```
- Install Expo in the terminal
  ```
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```
- Navigate to the chat-app directory and install all dependencies
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Set up Firebase for your project:
  - Sign in at firebase.google.com
  - "Create a project" or "Add new project" if this is not your first project.
  - Give your project a name, for example, "chat-app."
  - Enable or disable Google Analytics for this project. (For this project, I disabled Analytics)
- Create a Database to store the messages for your app
  - Use left-hand menu to build a database
    ```
    Build > Firestore Database > Create Database Button
    ```
  - Select a location for storing the data (messages)
    - Database ID is set to Default. From the dropdown menu, select the location closest to where your users are located
  - Set up Firestore Database to "Start in production mode" and click __Next__
  - On the "Rules" tab, adjust "allow read, write: if false;" to "allow read, write: if __true__;". Click Publish to save the changes
- Navigate to Project Settings (gear icon). Under the General tab, select "Your Apps." Choose a platform to start your app. For this project, I selected Web.
  ```
  Project Settings > General Tab > Your Apps > Web ( </> )
  ```
  - Name your app and click "Register"
  - Here you will find your web app's Firebase configuration. Use your configuration details to replace the existing configuration in App.js
    ```
    const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-authdomain",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    };
    ```
- Set up Firebase Storage to store images sent via the chat app
  - From your project dashboard, navigate to the "Build" section and select "Storage" and click the "Get Started" button
  - A popup will open that asks you to set your cloud storage. Keep everything on default and press __Next__, then __Done__
  - On the "Rules" tab, adjust "allow read, write: if false;" to "allow read, write: if __true__;". Click Publish to save the changes
- Navigate to the chat-app folder in the terminal and install Firebase
  ```
  npm install firebase
  ```
- Download the Expo Go app on your mobile device (or on an emulator like Android Studio) and open the app
  - _Make sure you are connected to WiFi!_
- In the terminal run __npm start__ or __expo start__ from the project directory
- You should now be able to use the chat app on your mobile device or emulator
- Happy coding!
