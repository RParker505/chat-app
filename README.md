# React Native Mobile Chat App
## Objective
To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location. It is optimized for both Android and iOS devices. Expo was used to develop the app and Google Firestore to store the chat messages and images/map views.
## User Stories
- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.
## Key Features
- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- Provide users with two additional communication features: sending images (either from device library or device camera) and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline, allowing users to access the chat and previous messages even when they are offline.
